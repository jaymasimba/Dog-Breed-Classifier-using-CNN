# Dog-Breed-Classifier-using-CNN
In the initial project, we develop an algorithm that can can be used as part of a mobile or web app for dog breed classification. The project takes any user-supplied image as input and supplies gives a breed classification if a dog is detected otherwise it gives the closest breed resemblance if a human is detected. 

The initial part of the project is to create a deepl learning architecture that can classify different breeds of dogs with an accuracy of over 10%. The created architecture(partly inspired by the squeezenet architecture) has on accuracy of 17% based on 23 epochs of training with room for improvement with further training.

The second part was to improve the model further by using a pretrained model. For this part, we selected the pre-trained resnet50 model and trained it over the images. The accuracy of the new model was 80% 
This project is part of the udacity Deepl learning nano degree program.
